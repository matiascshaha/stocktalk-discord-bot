## Workflow modeling guidance

- Keep workflows as simple as possible while preserving required controls.
- Document statuses and transitions explicitly for each project.
- Record which issue types use which workflows (workflow scheme mapping).
- Document where automation rules alter transitions, fields, or assignments.

## Definition of done

- Code merged and relevant tests pass.
- Contract/docs updated where behavior changed.
- Rollout notes or operational notes attached when risk exists.
