# Playwright Rule

Use these sources in order:
1. `docs/test-standards.md`
2. `docs/playwright-patterns.md`
3. `docs/selector-policy.md`
4. Relevant existing tests and fixtures

Expectations:
- Prefer semantic locators (`getByRole`, `getByLabel`) and stable test IDs.
- Reuse shared fixtures over ad hoc setup.
- Avoid fixed sleeps unless diagnosing a flaky failure.
- Run targeted Playwright checks first, then broader validation.
