# CI/CD Rule

Use these sources in order:
1. `docs/ci-cd-runbook.md`
2. `docs/runbook.md`
3. Relevant pipeline definitions and failing logs

Expectations:
- Identify first failing stage and root cause class (infra, env, flaky, regression).
- Prefer minimal stage-specific fixes before broad changes.
- Document risk and rollback when changing release or deployment behavior.
