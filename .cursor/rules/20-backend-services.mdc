# Backend Rule

Use these sources in order:
1. `docs/architecture.md`
2. `docs/conventions.md`
3. `docs/backend-patterns.md`
4. Relevant service code, tests, and contracts

Expectations:
- Preserve API contracts unless a breaking change is explicitly requested.
- Include tests with behavior changes.
- Prioritize minimal, reversible patches with clear validation evidence.
