'The Greenland Basket' ( *This is a trading basket/living thematic trade. Positions can change at any time, and new positions will be added*)

New position: Pangea Logistics $PANL - 4% weight @ $7.23 avg on shares, also very small spot in $7.5C for May

Arctic ambitions (military or commercial) turn into revenue only when cargo, fuel, equipment, and ore can be moved in constrained seasons. PANL is a way to own Arctic-capable tonnage and execution.

Pangaea positions itself as an operator of a fleet that includes high ice-class vessels. *30% of their entire fleet is Ice Class 1A vessels.* This distinguishes them from other U.S. operators/competitors such as $CMBT, which has only 10% of its fleet as Ice Class, and that too Class 1C which are far less capable.

Ice Class 1A / 1B / 1C is basically a “how winter-hardened is this cargo ship for ice?” scale.

1A is the strongest of the three, 1C the lightest.

The rules test whether the ship can keep about 5 knots in a channel of broken ice of a certain thickness (thicker for 1A than 1B than 1C).

IA (≈ 1A): can operate in severe ice conditions, assisted if necessary by an icebreaker.

IB (≈ 1B): can operate in moderate ice conditions, assisted if necessary.

IC (≈ 1C): can operate in light ice conditions, assisted if necessary.

In its Q3 2025 earnings press release, management explicitly attributes results to “solid Arctic trade activity” and “robust utilization across our niche ice-class fleet,” and states that its niche ice-class model drove TCE rates ~10% above the market; the release also claims operation of “the world’s largest high ice-class dry bulk fleet of Panamax and post‑Panamax vessels.”

Structurally, as Arctic traffic increases (Arctic Council shipping trends) and as defense infrastructure in Greenland/High North sustains operations (Pituffik resupply reality), demand for scarce ice-capable logistics can command premiums.

$PANL is the “real economy” expression of Arctic buildout: bulk cargoes, project freight, seasonal route optimization, port/terminal interfaces. 

The *unique angle* on Pangea is that they are the only U.S. company to have built a "temporary port" in Greenland, the Moriusaq, Greenland “pop-up port” concept using a Pangaea-owned barge and a trial Arctic shipment to deliver "the northernmost dry bulk cargo *ever carried*" -- I find this to be *highly significant*.

The daily chart is also an absolute beauty, consolidating cleanly after a gap-up last November.

Stock is cheap trading at 10x forward P/E and 10x price to free cash flow, 0.8x sales growing top line +15% Y/Y (so far).

My current shipbuilding exposure is $HII which we've owned since early last year and has done very well for us (nearly doubled from low $200s to $400+). However, I want to increase my exposure to the shipbuilding and U.S. naval expansion phenomenon. 

There is a tremendous amount of policy focus here and I don't think it's going away for the next few years, especially with the launch of the Trump-class battleship. 

A shipbuilding focus means more emphasis on domestic maritime capacity. In order to expand port infrastructure (deepening and/or widening of ports) & build waterways/channels for large ships, dredging activity is required.  

Dredging is the underwater excavation and removal of sediment, silt, and debris from the bottom of water bodies like rivers, lakes, and harbors Warships have hard draft/underkeel-clearance constraints, and dredging is how you keep those access channels usable over time as sediment accumulates. It's difficult to find pure-play exposure to dredging, as there are not many options, but one I find compelling is **Great Lakes Dredge & Dock $GLDD**. 

GLDD benefits from the Foreign Dredge Act / Jones Act regime, which significantly restricts foreign-built/foreign-operated vessels from competing in U.S. dredging and coastwise trades. GLDD is building Acadia, described as the first and only Jones Act–qualified SRI vessel being constructed in the U.S.One of the risks is their offshore wind exposure (because Trump hates wind energy), but at only 7% of their total backlog, I think this risk is minimal/muted by the greater business. 

Where's the direct policy linkage?

Trump’s April 2025 executive order (“Restoring America’s Maritime Dominance”) is framed as a maritime-industrial-base program, not just shipyard grants.

- The EO directs an assessment of investment options to expand the “Maritime Industrial Base,” explicitly including port infrastructure and maritime port access, alongside shipbuilding and ship repair.

- More funding/priority for federal navigation O&M (maintenance dredging) through the HMTF pathway

- More political urgency for capital deepening/widening at strategic ports/shipyard approaches (general-fund + cost-share projects), because bigger commercial and naval vessels force the issue.

Added stock at $13.95 and some $12.5C for March at $1.75 avg just to add some juice. 4.5% weighting.

In my view, one of the biggest themes of this year will be Edge Compute & On-Device Inference. 

Currently, the only position in my portfolio that addresses this theme is $OSS, which is a core position. However, I would like to layer exposure here with a few more stocks.

One of those stocks is **Synaptics $SYNA** 

You should think of an “AI-capable device” as having three big layers:

1. Sensors & inputs (camera, microphones, touch, motion sensors)
2. Local compute (the chips that run the model and decide what’s happening)
3. Connectivity (Wi‑Fi/Bluetooth/etc. to talk to phones, routers, or other devices)

SYNA has products that map to (2) and (3) directly, and it markets itself as providing an integrated edge stack (compute + connectivity + multimodal support)

SYNA’s SL2610 family is described as integrating:

- General compute (Arm CPU cores)
- GPUs (NVIDIA or otherwise)
- An AI acceleration subsystem (Synaptics' Torq platform)

In layman’s terms: it’s designed so an OEM can build a device that sees/hears something, runs an AI model locally, and reacts, *without needing a datacenter or offsite server*

*GOOGLE PARTNERSHIP*

On January 2, 2025, Synaptics announced it was collaborating with Google on Edge AI for IoT to define “optimal implementation of multimodal processing for context-aware computing,” integrating Google’s MLIR-compliant ML core on Synaptics Astra hardware with open-source software/tools.

In October 2025, Synaptics announced the SL2610 line and stated that Torq delivers the first production deployment of Google’s RISC‑V-based Coral NPU with dynamic operator support, using an open-source IREE/MLIR compiler/runtime approach.

Google’s own developer documentation calls Synaptics its *first strategic silicon partner* for Coral NPU and says SL2610 features the first production implementation of Google’s open-source Coral NPU ML core

*THE 'ASTRA' PROGRAM*

Astra is not a single chip. It’s Synaptics’ AI‑native IoT compute platform that bundles together processor families (silicon), SL-series (high power MPUs built on Arm Cortex CPUs), SR-series (low-power MCUs) + software, hardware & connectivity. 

Astra is Synaptics effort to sell the “whole kit” that makes an IoT device smart on its own: a processor that can run AI locally, the software tools to deploy models, and the dev hardware + wireless pieces to get a product built and shipped faster.

Astra launched in April 2024, but in October 2025 they updated Astra to the next generation *purpose-built* for edge AI workloads:

- Synaptics announced the Astra SL2600 Series, launching with the SL2610 product line, positioned for multimodal Edge AI and a wide set of IoT endpoints (appliances, automation, charging infrastructure, healthcare, retail POS/scanners, robotics/UAVs, etc.) -- this provides very robust *multi-theme exposure*

- SL2610 is explicitly tied to the Torq Edge AI platform and Google’s open Coral NPU

The thesis behind on-device compute is that: *some inference leaves the data center and moves to endpoints* Astra is a direct lever to this idea, because Astra is literally designed for endpoints that:

- generate raw data (camera/mic/sensor)
- need real-time responses
- can’t depend on network reliability

In my opinion, the company trades at a very reasonable valuation of 21x free cash flow, 21 trailing P/E, 15 forward P/E, 3x sales ($1.1B vs. $3B mkt cap) with a PEG ratio of 0.82 (which is below 1, implying the stock is undervalued). Management is guiding for 25-30% CAGR in their IOT business over the next 4 years, which is massive growth in the key segment considering this type of undemanding valuation.

I've added $SYNA shares at $85.78, 6% weight. The options are illiquid currently, but I may try to work into some $85C across multiple strikes if the spreads tighten. Earnings between Feb 4-9. If the earnings go well and corroborate my thesis, then there is a chance this will be designated as a core position. <@&933985135391547462>
